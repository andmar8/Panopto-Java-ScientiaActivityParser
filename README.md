Panopto-Java-ScientiaActivityParser
===================================

Using this tool we automatically create the csv required by Block Booker from activities in our timetabling system, given a little bit of tweaking this could be adapted to any other timetabling system... similarly to the booking engine, if you were to replace the scientia client sections with an interconnect to your timetabling system then the rest of the code will do the heavy lifting of talking to the Panopto server from there.
